# Adaptive-Hypergraph-Learning-with-Multi-Stage-Optimizations-for-Image-and-Tag-Recommendation
This is a Matlab implementation of HMSO and HMSO (LMS) of Adaptive Hypergraph Learning with Multi Stage Optimizations for Image and Tag Recommendation journal paper. 
# run HMSO
excecute main script in folder experiments_on_greek_pois_dataset.
## HMSO results compared to other methods

# run HMSO (LMS)
excecute main script in folder experiments_on_thessaloniki_dataset. Note: running HMSO (LMS) on a big dataset, such as greek_pois_dataset, has extremely high time requirements. Thus, we strongly recommend you run HMSO (LMS) on datasets with limited size.
